bni PDDL Parser and REPL
========================

A project focused on developing a parser for the PDDL (Planning Domain
Definition Language) in C. The project involves creating a tool for interpreting
PDDL, which converts domains and problems into data structures in C, enabling
efficient manipulation of language elements. Additionally, a REPL
(Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface is provided, allowing users to define and test
actions in a simulated environment, validating the preconditions and effects of
actions in automated planning problems.
